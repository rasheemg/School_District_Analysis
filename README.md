School district analysis with python and jupyter


Module 4 deliverable 3 Challenge Summary – Rasheem Gatewood


Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of the school district analysis was to help Maria, the Chief Data Scientists for the City School District with her task of analyzing performance trends and patterns.  I worked with Maria to analyze the data available including standardized test scores for math and reading for each school they attend; to showcase the trends and schools’ performance to help the school board and superintendent make decisions on the future budget and priorities for each school.  
Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
o	How is the district summary affected?
-	Comparing the two dataframes the averages show a difference when the 9th grade students Math and Reading scores from Thomas High Schools were excluded from the District Summary.
o	How is the school summary affected?
-	Thomas High School's % Overall Passing was 91, making it the second best.
-	After the data clean up Thomas High School's % Overall Passing was 65, moving the school to eight overall.
o	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
-	Replacing ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance between the other schools. The rankings for Thomas High School dropped significantly.
o	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
	Math and reading scores by grade
-	Math and Reading Scores from Thomas High School 9th Grade set to "nan" and equivalent to 0.
-	The only significantly score affected was minimal in a very small in quantity.
 
	Scores by school spending
-	The schools that spent more per student didn’t necessarily have more success with the students passing both math and reading. 
	Scores by school size
-	The schools with a smaller student count had better grades than the larger schools. The yalso had a significantly higher passing rate for both math and reading.
	Scores by school type
-	The charter schools faired significantly better than the district schools. 
 
 
Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

The percentage of students passing Math and Reading changes significantly but not but the school’s budget and how much the spend per student but Moreso the number of students in each school. The school with the higher population seems to have lower grades than the students with a smaller population despite having more funding and funding per student. Replacing the 9th grade students from Thomas high school hurt the schools averages.
